# atom-shortcuts package

I love shortcuts. I love to be productive. Shortcuts tend to increase developer's productivity by 146%.  To learn Atom's shortcuts I've found [this](http://d2wy8f7a9ursnm.cloudfront.net/atom-editor-cheat-sheet.pdf) cheatsheet and I liked it for the most part, except I had to toggle between Atom and Preview App to go and check for a shortcut needed for a certain action. That's why I wrote this extension. Simply hit **ctrl + `** (`ctrl + backtick`) and you will get a cheatsheet on your screen immediately.

Run ```apm install atom-shortcuts``` to install the package.
